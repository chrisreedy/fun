# Sliced ruler

This is a solution to the [FiveThirthEight Riddler Classic] problem of August
20, 2020. The problem asks for the expected length of the part of a foot long
ruler that contains the six inch mark. (See link for more complete description.)

The answer depends on the algorithm used to determine the locations for the
cuts. Here is a table that summarizes six different solutions:

| Algorithm | Expected Length |
| _________ | _______________ |
| Choose Three Independent Points | 5.625 (analytic, exact) |
| Choose x, then y, then z | 7.265298 (analytic, appoximate) |
| Choose y, then x and z | 6.341117 (analytic, approximate) |
| Choose x, then z, then y | 7.08(simulated) |
| Choose Longest for next Slice | 4.47 (simulated)|
| Choose Slice containing 6" for next | Slice 4:35 (simulated)|

The PDF [slicedruler.pdf](slicedruler.pdf) contains a description of the analysis. The Python program [ruler.py](ruler.py) was used to generated simulated results.
